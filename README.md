# Simple Blockchain Program

## Required Skills

1. know about blockchain
2. know about OOP with Python
3. learn how to use the hashlib module
4. learn how to use the datetime module

## What is Blockchain?
It is a database or ledger shared among computers network's nodes. It is a system for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions. Blockchains can be used to make data in any industry immutable â€”  the term used to describe the inability to be altered.

## Python-OOP
Object oriented programming is a programming paradigm that can be used in order to solve real-world problems. In object oriented programming we're gonna have classes and objects created basedd on those classes.

## hashlib module
In order to use the hashlib module we first need to import it.

After importing the hashlib module we create a variable that is to hold the hashing algorithm (we're using sha-256). Then we simply provide the string or any other type of value that we want to be coverted into hash of type byte.

You can now feed this object with bytes-like objects (normally bytes) using the update method.

Note:- A prefix of 'b' or 'B' is ignored in Python 2; it indicates that the literal
should become a bytes literal in Python 3
